# KaliLinuxRiceForMint

Was using linux mint xfce and riced it to look like kali to trick a friend.

now im using i3 and it doesn't give kali vibes like it did with xfce.

just pasting my configs here so they won't be permanently gone when i change everything out to something else (i'm still happy with what i did even tho it comes off as cringe or LARPy).
